## Approaches of re-examination of TSP instances within the MAMO complex 

We've adopted a three-steped approach to re-examine Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances. 
 1. Extract TSP Instances: We first extract TSP instances from a predefined range. Specifically, we've focused on instances with indices from 59 to 98. Each instance is identified and described using a structured JSON format. For example:

    {"index": 59, "output": "<type>Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</type>\n<explanation>The problem described involves finding a minimum-cost route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. This is a classic formulation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The key features that support this classification are:\n1. There are multiple cities (five in this case) which need to be visited.\n2. Each city must be visited exactly once.\n3. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the tour, where cost could represent distance, fuel expenses, or other factors.\n4. The problem requires returning to the starting city, completing the cycle.\nThese characteristics are defining elements of the TSP, making it the appropriate classification for this problem.</explanation>"}



 2.  LLMs assistant including Deepseek and GPT-4o, are used to generate the cost matrix for each instance. This data is rigorously cross-validated by  human experts to ensure accuracy. A sample cost matrix is provided below:
    
    [[0, 50, 48, 99, 91],
    [50, 0, 57, 84, 72],
    [48, 57, 0, 46, 86],
    [99, 84, 46, 0, 29],
    [91, 72, 86, 29, 0]
    ]
    
   
3. Optimal Solution via Enumeration: The optimal solution for each instance is found using a brute-force enumeration method. The Python implementation below iterates through all possible permutations of the tour to identify the minimum-cost path
```python

import itertools

# number of cities
n = 5

# cost matrix
cost = [
    [0,  50, 48, 99, 91],  # E
    [50, 0,  57, 84, 72],  # F
    [48, 57, 0,  46, 86],  # G
    [99, 84, 46, 0,  29],  # H
    [91, 72, 86, 29, 0]    # I
]
# start city 0（City 1）
start_city = 0
other_cities = list(range(n))
other_cities.remove(start_city)

min_cost = float('inf')
best_tour = None

# employ an enumeration method that systematically explores all possible tours
for perm in itertools.permutations(other_cities):
    tour = [start_city] + list(perm) + [start_city]  # 
    cost_sum = sum(cost[tour[i]][tour[i+1]] for i in range(n))
    
    if cost_sum < min_cost:
        min_cost = cost_sum
        best_tour = tour

# the output 
print(f"The minimum cost: {min_cost}")
print("The optimal tour:", ' -> '.join(f"City {i+1}" for i in best_tour))

```
