{"en_question": "A factory produces two types of food, I and II, and currently has 50 skilled workers. It is known that one skilled worker can produce 10  kg /  h of food I or 6  kg /  h of food II. According to contract bookings, the weekly demand for these two foods will rise sharply, as shown in Table 1-11. Therefore, the factory has decided to train 50 new workers by the end of the 8th week. It is known that a worker works 40  h per week, and a skilled worker can train up to three new workers in two weeks (during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production). The weekly wage of a skilled worker is 360 yuan, the weekly wage of a trainee during the training period is 120 yuan, and after training, the wage is 240 yuan per week, with the same production efficiency as skilled workers. During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work 60  h per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan. If the booked food cannot be delivered on time, the compensation fee for each week of delay per   kg is 0.5 yuan for food I and 0.6 yuan for food II.

{"en_question": "For the manufacturing industry, formulating an appropriate product production plan and human resource management scheme is very important for reducing operating costs, inventory costs, stockout costs, and labor costs. Specifically, for products with large demand fluctuations, companies need to accurately predict demand and formulate corresponding production plans. A certain company produces a type of foldable table, the raw material cost for each product is 90 Yuan, and the labor hours are 5 hours. The unit price of the product is 300 Yuan. The company has 1,000 workers at the beginning of January and holds an inventory of 15,000 units. The regular hourly wage for workers is 30 Yuan, with a normal daily working time of 8 hours. Any extra working time is considered overtime, with an overtime hourly wage of 40 Yuan. The number of working days per month is calculated as 20 days. Suppose the company's available production machines are sufficient, and the capacity is not limited by machine hours. Each worker's overtime hours do not exceed 20 hours per month. Holding inventory will generate corresponding inventory costs. If a stockout occurs due to insufficient capacity, there will be certain stockout costs. Additionally, the company can also make up for the stockout part through outsourcing. The outsourcing cost per product, monthly inventory cost, and monthly stockout cost are 200 Yuan, 15 Yuan, and 35 Yuan, respectively. The company's employees are temporary workers, and the company can flexibly decide the number of people to hire and fire each month. The cost of hiring and firing a single employee is 5,000 Yuan and 8,000 Yuan, respectively. Suppose the company has used the existing forecasting model to predict the demand from January to June, as shown in Table 4.1.\n\nTable 4.1: Demand Forecast\r\nMonth,1,2,3,4,5,6\r\nDemand Forecast,20000,40000,42000,35000,19000,18500\n\nPlease formulate a production plan, worker work schedule, and hire/fire plan for the company to maximize the total net profit over 6 months while ensuring that the company holds at least 10,000 units of products by the end of June.", "en_answer": "10349205.0"}

{"en_question": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig in 1959 (Dantzig and Ramser 1959). It is a very classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can usually be described as: In a certain area, there are a certain number of customers and a distribution center or warehouse. Customers are generally distributed in different locations, and each customer has a certain amount of delivery needs. The distribution center or warehouse needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design an appropriate delivery plan to meet the delivery needs of all customers. The goal of VRP is to optimize efficiency while meeting all customer needs. The efficiency is usually measured in the form of an objective function, which varies with the enterprise's requirements. Common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, and minimizing the number of vehicles used. In addition to meeting customers' delivery needs, VRP usually needs to consider various constraints, giving rise to various variants. For example, if the vehicle's load must not exceed its maximum capacity, the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP); if each customer's delivery needs must be met within a specific time window, the problem changes to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic problem developed from VRP. In reality, there are many application scenarios for VRPTW. Each customer point generally has a service time window. For example, some logistics centers need to store packages during less busy times, some large supermarkets need to replenish stocks during non-business hours, and real-time delivery methods such as food delivery require delivery within specific time windows. Time windows are divided into soft time windows and hard time windows. Hard Time Windows (HTW) mean that vehicles must arrive at or before the delivery point within the time window and cannot arrive late. If they arrive early, they must wait until the time window starts to perform the service, such as in supermarket restocking and logistics center warehousing. Soft Time Windows (STW) mean that vehicles do not have to arrive within the original hard time window but should try to arrive within it. If vehicles arrive early, there is a cost for early arrival; if they arrive late, there is a penalty, as seen in scenarios such as food delivery, school bus pick-up and drop-off, and industrial delivery.\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: There are a certain number of customer points and a distribution center in an area. Vehicles need to depart from and return to the distribution center, and routes should be continuous, with each customer being served by only one vehicle. Vehicles also have a capacity constraint. Each customer has a specific service time window and will only accept service within this window. Vehicles can arrive at customer points early and wait for the time window to open, or they can arrive within the time window to provide service. Vehicles can only start providing service within the time window, and the service time is known. The distribution center needs to arrange a reasonable delivery plan to complete the delivery tasks while minimizing travel costs. Since VRPHTW does not allow delays, it primarily emphasizes travel costs on the routes, similar to VRP. Please now proceed with operations research modeling for VRPHTW.", "en_answer": "1644.63"}

{"en_question": "A beverage factory produces a kind of beverage to meet market demand. According to market forecasts, the sales department of the factory has determined the demand for the beverage for the next 4 weeks. The planning department, based on the actual situation of the factory, has provided the production capacity and production cost for the next 4 weeks, as shown in Table 1. When there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid. How should the production plan be arranged to minimize the total cost (the sum of production cost and storage cost) over the four weeks while meeting the weekly market demand?\n\nTable 1 Beverage Production and Demand Data:\n\nWeek,Demand/1000 boxes,Production Capacity/1000 boxes,Cost per 1000 boxes/1000 yuan\r\n1,15,30,5.0\r\n2,25,40,5.1\r\n3,35,45,5.4\r\n4,25,20,5.5\r\nTotal,100,135,", "en_answer": "528"}
{"en_question": "A steel pipe retailer sources raw steel pipes from a steel pipe factory, cuts the pipes according to customer requirements, and sells them. The raw steel pipes obtained from the factory are all 1850 mm in length. A customer now needs 15 pieces of 290 mm, 28 pieces of 315 mm, 21 pieces of 350 mm, and 30 pieces of 455 mm steel pipes. To simplify the production process, it is required that no more than 4 types of cutting patterns are used. Suppose the cost of cutting one raw steel pipe is 1. The most frequently used cutting pattern incurs an additional cost of 1/10 of the value of a raw steel pipe, the second most frequent incurs an additional cost of 2/10, and so on. Moreover, the number of cuts for each pattern cannot be too many (a single raw steel pipe can produce up to 5 products). Additionally, to minimize waste, the leftover material for each cutting pattern should not exceed 100 mm. How should the material be cut to minimize total cost, and what is the total cost in this case?", "en_answer": "19.6"}
