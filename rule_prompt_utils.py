Below is an optimization modeling question. Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question: 
{{question}}
        * Make sure to import necessary packages, such as 'import coptpy as cp' and 'from coptpy import COPT'.
        * When you create a modelmake sure to use 'env = cp.Envr()' and 'model = env.createModel'
        * When you add a variable, use 'vtype = COPT.'
        * Do not name variables and constrains
        * Use '.addConstr' or '.addConstrs' to add constraints. If you want to set 'lb' or 'ub' as infinity, please use 'ls=COPT.INFINITY' or 'ub=COPT.INFINITY' instead of 'cp.INFINITY'.
        * When you set objective, you should use the 'model.setObjective' method and use 'COPT.MINIMIZE' or 'COPT.MAXIMIZE'.
        * Do not use 'model.optimize()'.
        * Make sure to use 'model.solve()' to solve the question.
        * The code output statement is:
            if model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:
                solution = var.getName(): var.X for var in model.getVars()
                print('Just print the best obj:', model.ObjVal)
