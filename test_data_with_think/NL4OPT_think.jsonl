{"en_question": "There has been an oil spill in the ocean and ducks need to be taken to shore to be cleaned either by boat or by canoe. A boat can take 10 ducks per trip while a canoe can take 8 ducks per trip. Since the boats are motor powered, they take 20 minutes per trip while the canoes take 40 minutes per trip. In order to avoid further environmental damage, there can be at most 12 boat trips and at least 60% of the trips should be by canoe. If at least 300 ducks need to be taken to shore, how many of each transportation method should be used to minimize the total amount of time needed to transport the ducks?<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to figure out how many boat and canoe trips are needed to transport at least 300 ducks while minimizing the total time. Let me start by understanding the constraints and the objective.\n\nFirst, the decision variables. Let me denote the number of boat trips as B and the number of canoe trips as C. These are integers because you can't have a fraction of a trip.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total time. Each boat trip takes 20 minutes, so total time for boats is 20*B. Each canoe trip is 40 minutes, so 40*C. So the total time is 20B + 40C. We need to minimize that.\n\nNow, the constraints. The first constraint is the number of ducks. Each boat takes 10 ducks, each canoe 8. So 10B + 8C ≥ 300. That's the duck capacity constraint.\n\nNext, there's a limit on boat trips: at most 12. So B ≤ 12. And then the requirement that at least 60% of the trips should be by canoe. Hmm, how to model that. The total trips are B + C. At least 60% of that should be C. So C ≥ 0.6*(B + C). Let me rearrange that. Multiply both sides by 1: C ≥ 0.6B + 0.6C → C - 0.6C ≥ 0.6B → 0.4C ≥ 0.6B → 2C ≥ 3B → 2C - 3B ≥ 0. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as C ≥ 0.6(B + C) → C ≥ 0.6B + 0.6C → 0.4C ≥ 0.6B → 2C ≥ 3B. So the constraint is 2C - 3B ≥ 0. Or another way: C ≥ (3/2)B. Wait, no. Let me check again. If 0.4C ≥ 0.6B, then dividing both sides by 0.2 gives 2C ≥ 3B. So yes, 2C ≥ 3B. So that's another constraint.\n\nAlso, since the number of trips can't be negative, B ≥ 0, C ≥ 0, and they should be integers.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDecision Variables:\nB: number of boat trips (integer)\nC: number of canoe trips (integer)\n\nObjective:\nMinimize 20B + 40C\n\nConstraints:\n10B + 8C ≥ 300\nB ≤ 12\n2C - 3B ≥ 0\nB ≥ 0, C ≥ 0, integers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"at least 60% of the trips should be by canoe\". So if total trips is T = B + C, then C ≥ 0.6T → C ≥ 0.6(B + C) → which simplifies to 2C ≥ 3B as before. So that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the model is correctly formulated. Let me check the constraints again.\n\nYes, the duck constraint is 10B + 8C ≥ 300. The boat trip limit is B ≤ 12. The canoe percentage constraint is 2C ≥ 3B. Also, B and C are non-negative integers.\n\nSo the mathematical model is set. Now, the next step is to code this in Gurobi using Python. Let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn Gurobi, we'll create variables B and C as integers. The objective function is straightforward. For the constraints:\n\n1. 10*B + 8*C >= 300\n2. B <= 12\n3. 2*C - 3*B >= 0\n\nWe'll add these constraints to the model. Then optimize and get the values of B and C.\n\nWait, but what if the optimal solution requires more than 12 boat trips? But the constraint B ≤ 12 ensures that. So the model should handle that.\n\nTesting with some numbers. Suppose B=12, then from the third constraint, 2C ≥ 3*12 → 2C ≥ 36 → C ≥ 18. Then the duck constraint: 10*12 +8*18= 120 +144=264, which is less than 300. So that's not enough. So we need more trips. Let's see, maybe increasing C beyond 18. Let's calculate for B=12, what's the minimum C needed? 10*12 +8C ≥300 → 8C ≥ 180 → C ≥ 22.5 → C=23. But with B=12, C must be at least 18 (from 2C ≥3*12 → C≥18). So 23 is acceptable. Then total time would be 12*20 +23*40=240 +920=1160 minutes. But maybe there's a better combination with lower B. Let's see. For example, if B is lower, maybe C can be adjusted to meet the 60% and duck constraints with lower total time.\n\nBut the model will find the optimal solution. So the code should correctly implement these constraints.\n\nAnother thing to note: the variables B and C must be integers. So in Gurobi, we'll set them as integer variables.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n- Import gurobipy\n- Create a model\n- Add variables B and C as integers with lower bounds 0\n- Set the objective as 20*B +40*C to minimize\n- Add the three constraints\n- Optimize the model\n- Print the solution\n\nI need to make sure that the constraints are correctly entered. Let me code that.\n\nWait, the third constraint is 2C -3B ≥0. So in Gurobi, that would be model.addConstr(2*C -3*B >= 0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nimport gurobipy as gp\nfrom gurobipy import GRB\n\nmodel = gp.Model(\"OilSpillTransport\")\n\nB = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"B\")\nC = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"C\")\n\nmodel.setObjective(20*B + 40*C, GRB.MINIMIZE)\n\nmodel.addConstr(10*B + 8*C >= 300, \"DuckConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(B <= 12, \"BoatLimit\")\nmodel.addConstr(2*C - 3*B >= 0, \"CanoePercentage\")\n\nmodel.optimize()\n\nThen, after optimization, print the values of B and C.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple optimal solutions? The problem probably expects the minimal time, so the code should find the optimal one.\n\nTesting this code would give the answer. Let me think if there are any possible errors. For example, if the model is infeasible. Let's check feasibility.\n\nIs there a feasible solution? Let's see. Suppose B=12, then C needs to be at least 18 (from 2C ≥36 → C≥18). Let's take C=23 as before. Then ducks are 10*12 +8*23=120+184=304 ≥300. So that's feasible. So the model is feasible.\n\nAnother example: B=0. Then C must be ≥0.6*(0 + C) → which is always true. But the duck constraint would be 8C ≥300 → C≥37.5 → C=38. Time is 0*20 +38*40=1520. Which is worse than the previous example. So the optimal solution is likely somewhere between B=0 and B=12.\n\nSo the code should work. Now, the model is correctly formulated.\n</think>", "en_answer": "1160.0"}
{"en_question": "A lab has 1000 units of medicinal ingredients to make two pills, a large pill and a small pill. A large pill requires 3 units of medicinal ingredients and 2 units of filler. A small pill requires 2 units of medicinal ingredients and 1 unit of filler. The lab has to make at least 100 large pills. However, since small pills are more popular at least 60% of the total number of pills must be small. How many of each should be made to minimize the total number of filler material needed?<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the lab needs to make large and small pills using medicinal ingredients and filler. The goal is to minimize the total filler used. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, there are 1000 units of medicinal ingredients. Each large pill uses 3 units of medicine and 2 units of filler. Each small pill uses 2 units of medicine and 1 unit of filler. The lab has to make at least 100 large pills. Also, at least 60% of the total pills must be small. We need to find how many of each pill to make to minimize the filler.\n\nHmm, so the decision variables here would be the number of large pills (let's say L) and the number of small pills (S). Both L and S should be non-negative integers, right? But since we're using Gurobi, maybe we can just use continuous variables and then check if the solution is integer, or maybe the problem allows for fractional pills? Wait, no, in reality, you can't make a fraction of a pill. But since the problem doesn't specify that the numbers have to be integers, maybe we can assume they can be continuous. Or perhaps the constraints will naturally lead to integer solutions. Hmm, but the problem says \"how many of each should be made,\" which implies integers. However, in optimization, unless specified, sometimes variables are continuous. But since the problem is about pills, which are discrete, I think we need to model them as integers. But maybe the problem expects a linear programming approach, so perhaps we can ignore the integrality and just state that the solution will be integer. Let me check the constraints.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. Medicinal ingredients: 3L + 2S ≤ 1000\n2. At least 100 large pills: L ≥ 100\n3. At least 60% of total pills are small: S ≥ 0.6*(L + S). Let me rearrange that. S ≥ 0.6(L + S) → S ≥ 0.6L + 0.6S → S - 0.6S ≥ 0.6L → 0.4S ≥ 0.6L → 2S ≥ 3L → S ≥ (3/2)L. Wait, that seems important. So S must be at least 1.5 times L. So S ≥ 1.5L.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. The original constraint is that at least 60% of the total number of pills are small. So S/(L + S) ≥ 0.6. Multiply both sides by (L + S): S ≥ 0.6(L + S) → S ≥ 0.6L + 0.6S → S - 0.6S ≥ 0.6L → 0.4S ≥ 0.6L → multiply both sides by 10: 4S ≥ 6L → 2S ≥ 3L → S ≥ (3/2)L. Yes, that's correct. So S must be at least 1.5 times L.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n- 3L + 2S ≤ 1000 (medicine)\n- L ≥ 100\n- S ≥ 1.5L\n- L ≥ 0, S ≥ 0\n\nBut since L is at least 100, and S is at least 1.5L, S will also be positive.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total filler used. Filler per large pill is 2, per small is 1. So total filler is 2L + 1*S. So the objective function is minimize 2L + S.\n\nNow, let's model this.\n\nDecision variables: L and S, both non-negative. But considering the constraints, L ≥ 100 and S ≥ 1.5L. Since L is at least 100, S is at least 150.\n\nNow, the problem is a linear program. Let me write the mathematical model.\n\nSets: Well, there are two types of pills, but maybe no need for sets here. The parameters are the coefficients in the constraints and objective.\n\nSo the mathematical model would be:\n\nMinimize 2L + S\n\nSubject to:\n\n3L + 2S ≤ 1000\n\nL ≥ 100\n\nS ≥ 1.5L\n\nL ≥ 0, S ≥ 0\n\nBut since L ≥ 100 and S ≥ 1.5L, the non-negativity is redundant here.\n\nNow, to implement this in Gurobi, we can define L and S as continuous variables, but since the problem may require integer solutions, perhaps we should set them as integers. Let me check if the optimal solution would be integer. The constraints involve fractions (like 1.5L), but if we model it properly, maybe the solution will be integer. Alternatively, we can set the variables as integers.\n\nBut let's proceed. In Gurobi, we can create variables L and S, add the constraints, and then optimize.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the code:\n\n1. Import gurobipy.\n\n2. Create a model.\n\n3. Add variables L and S, type continuous or integer? Well, the problem says \"how many of each should be made,\" so they must be integers. But in some cases, the LP relaxation might give an integer solution. However, to be safe, we can set them as integers. Let's do that.\n\n4. Add constraints:\n\n   a. 3*L + 2*S <= 1000\n\n   b. L >= 100\n\n   c. S >= 1.5*L → which can be written as S - 1.5*L >= 0.\n\n5. Set the objective as 2*L + S to minimize.\n\n6. Optimize and get the solution.\n\nBut wait, in Gurobi, when you have a constraint like S - 1.5L ≥ 0, you can write it as model.addConstr(S - 1.5*L >= 0).\n\nBut since L and S are integers, does that affect anything? For example, if L is 100, then S must be at least 150. If L is 101, S must be at least 151.5, but since S is integer, it must be at least 152. However, in the model, if we model the constraint as S - 1.5L ≥ 0, and S and L are integers, then the solver will handle the fractional part appropriately. But in reality, when L is an integer, 1.5L could be a fractional value. For example, if L is 100, 1.5*100=150, which is integer. But if L is 101, 1.5*101=151.5, so S must be at least 152. However, in the model, if we use continuous variables, the solver might suggest S=151.5, but since we need integers, we have to round up. But since we are using integer variables, Gurobi will automatically handle this by finding the minimal integer S that satisfies the constraint. Therefore, setting the variables as integers is necessary here.\n\nSo in the code, we should define L and S as integers. Let me adjust the model accordingly.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nImport gurobipy as gp.\n\nCreate model.\n\nAdd variables L and S, type GRB.INTEGER.\n\nAdd constraints:\n\n3*L + 2*S <= 1000\n\nL >= 100\n\nS >= 1.5*L\n\nObjective: minimize 2L + S.\n\nThen optimize and print the solution.\n\nBut wait, in Gurobi, when you have a constraint like S >= 1.5*L, and L is integer, how does that work? For example, if L is 100, then S must be at least 150. If L is 101, S must be at least 151.5, which would require S to be 152. So the constraint is linear and can be handled as is. Gurobi will take care of the integrality.\n\nTesting with some values. Suppose L=100, then S must be at least 150. Then 3*100 + 2*150 = 300 + 300 = 600, which is under 1000. So there's room for more. Maybe we can increase L and S to use up the medicine.\n\nBut the objective is to minimize filler. Let's see. For each large pill, we use 2 units of filler, small 1. So to minimize filler, we want as many small pills as possible. But there's a constraint that at least 60% are small. So perhaps making as many small as possible given the constraints.\n\nBut the constraints are that S ≥ 1.5L. So for each large pill, we need 1.5 small. So if we increase L, we have to increase S even more, which might use more medicine. Wait, but the medicine is limited. So there's a trade-off.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we fix L=100. Then S must be at least 150. Let's compute the medicine used: 3*100 + 2*150 = 300 + 300 = 600. That leaves 400 units of medicine. Can we make more pills? Let's see. Suppose we try to make more small pills. But since S is already at the minimum required by the 60% constraint. Wait, the 60% constraint is S ≥ 1.5L. So if we increase S beyond 1.5L, that's allowed. But since we want to minimize filler, which is 2L + S, making more small pills (which have less filler) is better. So perhaps we can increase S as much as possible given the medicine.\n\nWait, but the medicine is 3L + 2S ≤ 1000. If L is fixed at 100, then 3*100 + 2S ≤ 1000 → 2S ≤ 700 → S ≤ 350. But the minimum S is 150. So the maximum S is 350. So if we set S=350, then total filler is 2*100 + 350 = 550. If we instead make more L and adjust S accordingly.\n\nFor example, suppose L=200. Then S must be at least 300. Medicine used: 3*200 + 2*300 = 600 + 600 = 1200, which exceeds 1000. Not allowed. So that's not feasible. So L can't be 200. Let's find the maximum possible L such that 3L + 2S ≤ 1000 and S ≥ 1.5L.\n\nLet me substitute S with 1.5L into the medicine constraint. Then 3L + 2*(1.5L) = 3L + 3L = 6L ≤ 1000 → L ≤ 1000/6", "en_answer": "350.0"}
